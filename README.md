### Hi there 👋

👋 Hi, I’m @Moirasfallout! I am just learning coding and am diving right in! Any tips and hints are appreciated

👀 I’m interested in just learning the basics, I am doing this for fun and to see if I can create some fun things for myself and friends to just mess around with. I got inspired by a friend who does some web development but not alot of actual coding. I wanted to see what the world of coding had to offer and always was intrigued by game development since I was a young teen but never thought someone like me could do it! With more and more open source options being released all the time I decided to finally dip my toes in and explore something I've been curious about for a long time even if it is just for fun.

🌱 I’m currently learning... I honestly don't know where to start. I figure I will start with 1 language and 1 program to keep it simple as thats the recommendation but there is so much information out there I am still sorting out where to start! I am just excited to be starting and even if I never go far, anything I learn will be progress and I am excited to see where this takes me and to learn something new. After all, progress is progress and even if in the next few years I can only make a simple program with 1 interaction it is more than I can do now and that is something I would be proud of.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment haha. I have no knowledge that would be beneficial as I don't know anything about coding and development at the moment! Maybe in the future this will change but if anyone wants to reach out and give me hints or tips to help me progress it would be greatly appreciated!

📫 How to reach me ... moirasfallout@gmail.com or my Twitter @Moirasfallout are great ways to reach me! I am excited to learn and even if you just want to reach out and say "Hello" I would love that! Any and all interactions are welcome and I will do my best to respond!

I hope anyone who read all this has a great day and goodluck on all your future projects! Every contribution here is a huge inspiration to me and shows me how much shared knowledge and talent is truly out there. Thank you for welcoming me to this site and I look forward to all future interations! <3 <3 <3
